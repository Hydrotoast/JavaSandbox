Red Wind" by Raymond Chandler: Main Page

Chapter 1

One day Philip Marlowe, the protagonist, walks into a bar owned by a young man. There is no one else in the bar besides himself, the owner, and a drunk man in the back of the bar. The drunk man requests more beer which inevitably adds to his drunken state. The owner feels bad about not satisfying his requests so he waters down the beer; the man is too drunk to notice. Another man walks inside the bar in a hurry, leaving his car running outside. The man buys a scotch on the run while the drunk is playing checkers and notices him inside the bar. He his staring at the new customer while he asks if anyone has seen a lady who is tall, pretty, and wearing a print bolero jacket over a blue crepe silk dress. All of a sudden, the drunk man stands up and calls the new customer Waldo; he pulls out a .22 automatic gun and shoots him right on the heart. The drunk man then runs out into Waldo's car and drives off. The cops arrive, asking the owner and Philip questions about what happened and personal questions.

Chapter 2

Philip then goes back to his apartment and notices a lady wearing a bolero jacket inside the elevator and starts to question her. She was very nervous and skeptical at first, but he informs her that he is a detective. He does not allow her to exit the elevator because he is afraid the cops will find and arrest her. The woman starts arguing with Philip but stops the conversation when she mentions Waldo's name. He asks about Waldo and describes the event that just took place. He asks more questions about Joseph Coates, the name the woman calls Waldo, and she said she was meeting up with him to buy pearls that were worth fifteen thousand dollars. She mentions that she has a husband and how he is always busy in business meetings. Philip tells her to take off her bolero jacket and to keep an eye out for police. He goes into his apartment and hears knocking on his door. He opens it to find a gun being pointed at his head.

Chapter 3

A man is pointing a gun directly at his head as he is walking into the apartment. The drunk, Al Tessilore, explains that Waldo robbed a bank and he was to blame for it. He had been looking for Waldo and finally found him in the bar. The drunk man had the gun right at his throat but Philip could not do anything because he was paralyzed. A girl comes out of the dressing-room wall, behind the drunk,  stabs his gun hand while Philip knees his groin. The girl left the apartment in a hurry, without the bolero jacket.
Chapter 4

Philip hears a voice and sees a Cadillac Coupe parked outside; it is the woman from earlier. She tells him that she wants the pearls that Waldo has and Philip reassures her he will do his best to get them. She introduces herself as Lola and informs him that she hired Waldo while her husband was in Argetina for business. Her husband kicked Waldo out once he came back because they were so close, but Waldo kept the pearls to offer them back to her. Philip sneaks into Waldo's apartment to look for the pearls; he fails to find them. Instead Philip makes a horrifying discovery of a dead body. He sends Lola back home and asks her not to mention anything about them being together.
Chapter 5

He goes to a small house past Sawtelle where a woman is surprised to find Philip at her door. He talks to the woman until her husband walks in with a gun inside his robe pocket. Philip tells him that Mrs. Kolchenko's car was borrowed and he brought it back; the person who borrowed it was not able to bring it back. Philip asks for five hundred dollars in return to keep away suspicion of the man in the robe during the investigation.  They agree and Philip goes home.

Chapter 6

Philip goes home at around 3 A.M. and has unexpected guests in his apartment, Copernik and Ybarra. Copernik is holding the bolero jacket and tosses it around the card table. He questions Philip and tries to get as much information from him that he felt Philip was hiding. Copernik mentions they have Waldo's getaway car and pulls out a string of pearls. They ended up being phony pearls worth only about one hundred dollars. Copernik pulls out the gun and tells Ybarra to put it up as well, pointing it at Philip. Philip starts feeling tired so he tells them where Lola and her husband live and to take the pearls.
Chapter 7

Later that night Lola calls Philip telling him that the cops found the pearls. He promised her the pearls the next day so he goes out to a jewelry store to find identical pearls. He buys pearls that are not identical and they meet at the bar as planned. She is convinced that they were not her pearls. Philip walks out the bar without turning back and drives out near Malibu. In memory of Mr. Stan Phillips, he places the pearls on the water and lets seagulls splash them away.


Characters

Philip Marlowe

The narrator and the main character of the story.

 

Philip Marlowe is a private investigator, so as for his character he has to be very observant. When Philip tells his story of the stolen necklace in “Red Wind”, he goes into detail regarding his surroundings; he focuses on details regarding the people he encounters. He can name every detail of the person in the room with him. When speaking, his speech expresses the emotion of confidence but at the same time has a clever tone. Another technique included in his speech is one of humor, which he uses to get out of tight situations for example the interrogations he encounters with Detective Copernik. While working on his own investigations he likes to keep everything very low-key and away from the knowledge of the two detectives. Philip Marlowe follows the characteristic of a traditional racist white man when he confronting people of various minority backgrounds. 
Lola Barsaly

A beautiful woman with blue eyes and wavy brown hair.

Lola is a married woman with lots of money. Her money of course belongs to her husband. Lola is a woman that loves to seek for trouble and uses money as her problem solver. She tends to do a lot of activities behind her husband’s back while he’s at work or on vacations. One predicament she got involved was that she would go out on “dates” with her chauffer Joseph Coates whom later stole a very expensive necklace. This situation is what brought her and Philip Marlowe together. Her attitude when speaking to Philip is one that is very uncooperative and selfish. Lola’s dialogue is less descriptive and has a strong dependence on what happens to herself.
Detective Lieutenant Copernik

Det. Copernik was one of the two detectives that did most of the speaking during interrogations. In comparison to his partner he is taller in height and gives the impression of a tough guy. His confidence level is on high levels and is willing to get straight to the point when interviewing witnesses.
Detective Ybarra

Ybarra a Latino detective was short in height and the quitter detective.

To differentiate him from his partner he is the nice detective. His personality doesn’t revolve around speaking and asking questions but more on observing. He’s not the typical “in your face” detective because he actually listens when interviewing.
Joseph Coates

His physical statue may be considered as a dark, good looking man.

 

His first appearance was that of a smooth man that had no problems in his life. Turned out this man had history in two-facing his closest peers in his younger days. One of his past occupations was of a chauffeur. His other occupation before being a chauffeur is one of being criminal. He had a history of being in bank robberies and backing up his criminal history he stole necklace from Lola and was planning in selling it back to her but little did she know they were fake. His criminal ways finally caught up to him when he entered Lew’s bar and ran into Al.  Joseph was shot by his old friend Al in cold blood in front of Philip and the bartender Lew. After investigations, the reason of the murder was because Al was one of the people Joseph had double crossed.
Al Tessilore

 

First impression is that this guy is a lunatic. Al kills Joseph at the bar for job gone bad in a past bank robbery. He served time because Joseph had snitched and blamed Al and this caused him to go out on a rampage and seek revenge. After the crime he looks for Philip and sneaks into his home to get rid of any witness of his murder; Philip was a witness. This murderer falls short to the intelligence of Marlowe and is beat up by Marlow. Marlow kept a conversation going to stall and strike him. He is the cuffed and arrested by the two detectives for the murder of Joseph Coates.
Lew Petrolle

Lew is the owner of the bar in which the crime happened.

His father gave him an amount of 1000 dollars to start his own business. Lew decided to go into the alcohol business even though he hates drunks. He hates the fact that these men get flat out drunk in his bar and start problems. Lew is the type of guy that looks a lot for himself and anybody else just doesn’t matter to him. After the shooting and while the detectives were interviewing Marlowe, he showed no sympathy and just started to count his money.

Genre, Medium & Conventions

Medium & Genre

Under the publication of Dime Detective Magazine's 1938 January edition, the original story was categorized under the detective fiction genre (Seals); however, Chandler's transcendence of the genre closely relates to conventions of the contemporary Noir. The intermediary genre, Hardboiled, classifies brutal crime fiction protraying violence and sexuality without sentiment (Moss).

The medium of the magazine made the story pulp fiction, an inexpensive read for a massive, general audience. To the left is the original cover for the January 1938 edition of the Dime Detective Magazine where "Red Wind" was originally published (Smith).
Conventions

There are many conventions attributed to "Red Wind" as both a detective fiction and Noir. Shared conventions include mystery, crime and violence.
Atmosphere & Weather

    The weather is a motif using the Santa Ana Winds:

        “There was a desert wind blowing that night. It was one of those hot dry Santa Anas that come down through the mountain passes and curl your hair and make your nerves jump and your skin itch. On nights like that every booze party ends in a fight. Meek little wives feel the edge of the carving knife and study their husbands' necks. Anything can happen. You can even get a full glass of beer at a cocktail lounge” (Chandler 1).

    From the beginning of the story, the winds uphold the atmosphere until the very end which appears on nearly every single page.
Cityscape

    Urban settings are common conventions in the Noir genre because of their symbolic attributes with "ambiguity and contradiction." Hausladen and Starrs describe the urban environment as a labyrinth for three layers of each story: a physical maze for the roads and structures; a relational maze for the interactions between characters; and a psychological maze for the narrator or protagonists' thoughts (Hausladen & Starrs, 2005).
Femme Fatale

    Lola Barsaly could be the femme fatale for whose seduction becomes the end of several men and the misfortune of others such as Waldo and Marlowe respectively.
Ambiguous Characters

    The motivation and intentions of each character differs with the dirty of work of P.I. Marlowe for the sake of a woman to the prideful and corrupt work of the cop, Copernik. Detective Ybarra also exhibits ambiguity through his complex representation as the clever cop in the story contrasting against both Copernik's savagery and Mrs. Kolchenko's stereotyped behavior (Seals).
Crime & Violence

    There are several instances of crime starting from the beginning of the novel with the murder of Waldo by his former accomplice, Al Tessilore. Next, Tessilore holds up Marlowe in his own home. Finally, Leon, another hustler, was found murdered by Tessilore. In short, there are several murders.

    However, not all crime is necessarily violent. Marlowe breaks into rooms for evidence and scavenges through other peoples' items.

Historical Context & Audience

Author

Raymond Chandler began writing, mainly poems, in college; however, his writing was put on hold when he served in the Canadian army during World War I. After the war, he married and worked as a bookkeeper and auditor at an oil syndicate where he eventually became vice president. Unfortunately, he lost his job during the Great Depression due to his constant drinking and habitually not going to work. It was at this time that Chandler returned to his passion- writing. He started writing short stories that were published in Black Mask, the leading pulp magazine in the the 30s, as well as Dime Detective, which is where “Red Wind” was first published. Writing stories for these magazines was not only helpful in gaining recognition in the world of crime fiction, but also allowing him to polish his skills and develop his writing style.

Raymond Chandler paved the way for film noir. He used his ability to create emotion through description and dialogue to bring to life twisted tales “... where lawlessness and luxury were old drinking buddies, and trust was a rare commodity...” (Pierce, “Raymond Chandler”). He also created the foundation for the private detective who will do what ever it takes to uncover the truth and save the damsel in distress; Philip Marlowe(even though he was created after "Red Wind") is the epitome of this “savior,” if you will, as well as the basis of the numerous detectives that have been given life since Chandler.
History
Publication

1938 was a hard year that was followed by many equally tragic, if not more devastating years. These were hard times for people, where the only escape from the harsh reality was through the always changing world offered through the written world. Movies were also available, but it was far easier to get a hold of the printed word. There were many magazines, among them Black Mask and Dime Detective, that were mass produced and cheap. This allowed anyone to pick it up and get lost in a world full of corruption and betrayal, but with a beacon of light (the detective) shining, guiding them to the truth and bringing hope to the world outside the printed pages.

The story "Red Wind" was written in late 1937 and published in January of 1938. This was the first of two that was published Dime Detective that year. This was a time where the world was on the brink of its second world war and the fight between capitalism/democracy and communism.
Racial Discrimination

Segregation and animosity towards minorities was prominent in society. Even though the Civil Rights Movement wasn't for another decade or so, minorities were trying to integrate into society and gain more rights; however, with the crash of the economy and impending war, it was near impossible to gain equality. They were able to make some process in the war by joining the military and being able to fight on the front lines. Even though they were not integrated with white platoons and they had white superiors, they were proving that they belonged and wanted to fight for their country. It is because of that determination that they were able to gain more trust and responsibility in World War II. Chandler's views on minorities and/or his understanding of society's views o minorities is evident in Red Wind through his description of them.

1938 marked the beginning of a dark age. With all of these horrific events beginning to form, Chandler incorporates the Santa Ana winds as a dangerous aura that may have been common in society. 
Audience
Primary Audience

When "Red Wind" was published, many people found themselves unemployed, struggling to survive and provide for their families on a day-to-day basis. Life had become significantly difficult for everyone. It was no longer only the minorities and the poor struggling to survive, but the majority of society These people were the primary audience. The people who needed an escape from their dismal lives and were also intrigued by the mysteries that surround murder.
Secondary Audience

The secondary audience would be those who read this story after this dark time; after noir became lost in the sea of genres. These are people who either read it because they are fascinated by noir and have a deeper understanding and appreciation, or want to gain a better insight, of all of its conventions and classifications, or those who read it as an assignment for educational purposes.
Society in 1938

There is a difference between the audience in 1938 and the audience now. Noir was just beginning to form, so there was the excitement that accompanies all new trends. Many people were interested by this new style of writing even though it was dark and twisted. With devastating blow to financial security and war on the horizon, it was easy to connect with tales of corrupt leaders, greed consuming the most virtuous man and dirty secrets uncovered with murder. 
 
 
 
Present Society

In today’s world, crime solving is definitely prevalent in society. There are numerous shows about murder and serial killers and the psychology behind it. These are different than the noir of the 30s, but they are a branch of it. We still have the twists in motive and intersection of people’s lives, however there is a shift in the way these stories are told. In todays stories, the good guys don’t usually succumb to the temptation of a femme fatale, or crime in general. The people who read noir today understand and appreciate the difference and, in my opinion, are intrigued by noir because it is “darker” than the crime solving genre of today.

Symbols & Themes

Symbols:

The Hot Wind

    Throughout the story, the hot wind is mentioned several times, at least once in each chapter. The hot wind is used to symbolize certain transition phases within the story, and other times the hot wind is used as a scapegoat for the disturbed moods of the characters.

    “My mouth felt suddenly hot and dry. Far off I heard the wind booming. It seemed like the sound of guns.” (Ch. 6) In this scene the narrator, Philip Marlowe, describes his internal feelings as Copernik interrogates him and is looking for trouble, and Philip is possibly in great danger of losing his life. The wind booming in the background is used to symbolize the intensity of the scene and reflects the horrific mood of the scene.

    As the chapter continues, the following phrase, “It’s the hot wind, Sam. Let’s forget it,” is used by Copernik to end the scene in which he had just finished violently beating Philip. The hot wind symbolizes a possible scapegoat for the characters in which the blame goes towards the weather whenever the characters are bad tempered.
The Printed Bolero Jacket

    The jacket is highly significant throughout the story because it symbolizes evidence and Philip’s fate. The jacket is what caught Philip’s attention when he ran into Mrs. Barsaly in the elevator and causes him to tell her that the police are looking for her.

    The jacket, along with the blue crepe silk dress, was used to describe the pretty woman, and the cops were easily able to find evidence through the jacket.

    The jacket symbolizes Philip’s fate in Chapter 6, in which he is being beaten and nearly killed by Copernik. The cops searched Philip’s apartment and found the jacket hidden in his drawers, which led to Philip’s secrets being revealed to the cops, as well as his interrogation by the cops.
The Fake Pearls

    The fake pearls in the story that were given to Lola as a gift by her former, now dead, lover symbolize a false fantasy. It is unknown whether Lola’s former lover lied to her and gave her cheap pearls that were not worth fifteen grand, but it is implied that Joseph Coates most likely sold the original pearls and was going to sell Lola back some fake pearls.

    However, Lola realizes at the end of the story that perhaps she really wasn’t in love with Stanley, the man that gave her the pearls, and that it was just an illusion she was not able to let go of for the longest time. The fake pearls that are returned to Lola are not as beautiful as real ones, just like Lola’s current marriage is not beautiful and is an unfaithful union.

    In the end of the story, Philip throws the fake pearls into the ocean to symbolize Lola’s lost relationship and the ending of a fantasy attachment.

Themes:

Corruption

    Corruption is a theme in this story because the police system is significantly corrupted and filled with lies. For instance, the police chooses not to report every single detail about the crimes made, and leaves out major details in an exchange made between Philip and Ybarra and Copernik. The dead body of Leon Valesanos is not mentioned in the newspaper until a few days later. Barsaly’s and Lola’s names are left out of the newspaper in exchange for money and to protect their identities.
 
 
Infidelity
    Infidelity is a theme in this story because both Lola and Mr. Barsaly are unfaithful to each other and have relationships on the side without either of them knowing. Lola kisses Philip, although Philip knows that she is married. Lola believes that her husband is at a business meeting, when in reality, he is staying at another place with a Russian girl. Both of them are fooled in the end.
